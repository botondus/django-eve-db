django-eve-db is a set of `Django`_ models that wrap CCP's EVE Online data
dump. This makes it extremely easy to query the dump and rapidly
develop software around it. Little to no SQL is required for many usage cases.

Getting Started
---------------

For details on how to get started using this software, see the
`Getting Started`_ page. Note that since this app requires django-eve-api and
django-eve-proxy, it may be better to just install `django-eve`_, which wraps
all of these into a neat starter project framework.
